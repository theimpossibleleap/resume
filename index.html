            <p>Thank you for taking the time to read my resume. I really appreciate it! As a student working towards my Bachelor of Science in Software Development, I wanted to have a tangible project for potential employers to reference. I coded this website from scratch utilizing HTML and CSS. I have not integrated any JavaScript, although I will be doing so in the future. This is hosted on my GitHub account, and displayed using GitHub Pages. I have strictly used VS Code, and it's built in Terminal, to code, commit, and push my updates to GitHub. This was my way of teaching myself a workflow for GitHub. Front End Development is a field I am looking to grow in to and move my career towards!</p>

            <p>A little bit about me.. I currently live in Las Vegas, NV. Unlike most people, I was born and raised here. I have a deep passion for cooking, baking, coffee, technology, travel, and carpentry. I'm a very curious person! Whenever I hear something is challenging to do, I want to try and master it! This includes baking macarons to remodeling my entire kitchen myself. All it takes some times is blood, sweat, Google, and YouTube. I'm currently deep in to A-Frame cabin building.. I'll try and make that happen soon!</p>

            <p>Technology has been a huge part of my life since I was a kid. My neighbor taught me how to run Doom through a command prompt, on a floppy disk, in 1994. Ever since then I've been interested in computers, technology, and learning how it all works. I started building websites in the late 90s / early 2000s. It was a lot of copy and pasting.. Remember Geocities? I'm glad I stuck with it though! As mentioned above, I am working towards acheiving my BS in Software Development. Professionally, I'm currently a Manager with Apple Retail. It has truly been an amazing experience. But, I'm excited for the next chapter in my career as I pursue positions more relevant to my learning and future growth!</p>

            <p>Thank you for taking the time to read and visit my website! Please reach out for any further information or inquiries. My "professional" resume can be found <a href="files/Resume.pdf">here</a></p>
